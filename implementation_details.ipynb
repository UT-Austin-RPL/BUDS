    "### Implementation for Multi-sensory Representation Learning\n",
    "We use the same convolutional network structures as the models from\n",
    "Lee et al.[1], except that we do not have skip connections from the\n",
    "encoder to the decoder parts. We choose 32 for the latent dimension\n",
    "of the fused representation. For training the fusion model for each\n",
    "task, we use 1000 training epochs, with a learning rate of 0.001,\n",
    "batch size of 128.\n",

    "### Hyperparameters for Skill Segmentatation.\n",

    "We present the hyperparameters for the unsupervised clustering\n",
    "step. The maximum number of clusters for each task is: 6 for\n",
    "<tt>Tool-Use</tt> and <tt>Hammer-Place</tt>, 8 for <tt>Kitchen</tt>\n",
    "and <tt>Real-Kitchen</tt>, 10 for <tt>Multitask-Kitchen</tt>. And\n",
    "the stopping criteria of the bread-first search is the number of\n",
    "segments of mid-level segments are more than twice the maximum number\n",
    "of clusters. We also use a minimum length threshold to reject a small\n",
    "cluster, the number we choose is: 30 for <tt>Tool-Use</tt>,\n",
    "<tt>Real-Kitchen</tt>, 35 for <tt>Hammer-Place</tt>, 20 for\n",
    "<tt>Multitask-Kitchen</tt>. In this work, these values of\n",

    "simulation and real robots). We choose H=20 for the multitask\n",
    "environment <tt>Multitask-Kitchen</tt>. This is because skills are\n",

    "### Training Details for Sensorimotor Policies\n",

    "augmentation [2] to images for both training skills and meta\n",

    "$\\pi^{(k)}_{L}$, we also add some noise from Gaussian distribution\n",

    "For all skills, we train for 2001 epochs with a learning rate of\n",
    "$0.0001$, and the loss function we use is $\\ell_{2}$ loss. We use two\n",
    "layers (300, 400 hidden units for each layer) for the fully\n",

    "(`300`, 300, 400) hidden units for each layer for fully connected\n",
